## Task 1: Data Visualization â€“ Bar Chart & Histogram

This task was completed as part of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Infotech using Google Colab. The objective was to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using Python libraries.

 Objective:
To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of variables such as age or gender in a population dataset.

### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used:
- Google Colab (for coding and visualization)
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

Key Activities:
- Loaded a dataset directly into Google Colab
- Preprocessed and cleaned the data
- Created a **bar chart** to show gender distribution
- Created a **histogram** to show age distribution
- Enhanced the visuals with labels, colors, and legends

 Outcome:
This task enhanced my understanding of data visualization techniques and how to choose the right chart type based on data type (categorical vs continuous). It also improved my hands-on skills using Google Colab for data analysis projects.
